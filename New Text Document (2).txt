Dear sir,
I hope this mail finds you well. My name is Nguyen Duc manh and I have been a member of food club for about 1 year.
I writing express feelings and suggestions regarding your previous letter. According to the announcement ddeef bafi. To be honest, I was excited at first.
From my opinion, firstly, the club should organise face-to-face meeting for member to discouss this problem, secondly, we can meet at the weekend because all member are free, thirdly, it is will be comfortable to hold the meeting in community house, coffee shop or park. I think that will help the club have a chance top give the best solution.
I think a lot of people have the same opinion as me 
I look forward to hearing your respone if my recommendations are accepted
Best regards.
Nguyen Duc manh
